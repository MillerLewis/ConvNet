# ConvNet
Self implemented ConvNet

The following repository is my attempt at implementing a convnet without using tensorflow. I have used both numpy and scipy (scipy for the convolution operation).

However, I am leaving it a bit unfinished for now. Although the program runs, it doesn't run correctly. It doesn't actually classify the images correctly. In my opinion, this means I've implemented the back propagation incorrectly.
